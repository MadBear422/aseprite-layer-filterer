# Layer Filterer for Aseprite

Aseprite extension that lets you quickly isolate and show only layers matching a search term, hiding all others. Also provides a one-click button to unhide all unlocked layers. Perfect for navigating complex projects with many layers.

No credit is needed for using this script, modify it however you like. Any suggestions or contributions are welcome. I can't guarantee I will update this script frequently.
